Mission statement:

The **EuBIC** initiative, supported by **EUPA**, is a new open community of both users and experts in computational proteomics and related mass spectrometry fields. It is a platform that provides targeted training and support for every level of expertise for any profession (PhD students, researchers, companies), defining guidelines for bioinformatics solutions, development and (re)usage with coordination of software development efforts and as the ultimate goal, to make the field of computational proteomics more accessible to society.

The community will establish guidelines and provide support to increase the quality and sustainability of bioinformatics solutions in computational proteomics.
Our mission is to:

1. build a community of bioinformaticians in computational proteomics,
2. bridge the gap between users and developers of bioinformatics solutions
3. implement a quality assessment for tools, scripts and related topics
4. identify key research lines and establish coordinated expert groups for their investigation
5. organize educational sessions (congresses, workshops, webinarsâ€¦)
6. provide follow-up help for the integration of existing tools in workflows
7. raise awareness for the benefits of continuously supported open software
8. accredit tools that conform high quality standards.
